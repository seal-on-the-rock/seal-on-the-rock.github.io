# ☁️ My First Technical Article


I decided to start sharing what I’ve learned through my work and study in technology.
This space will be where I record insights, summarize knowledge, and reflect on ideas related to system engineering, cloud computing, and accounting systems.

Rather than being a tutorial site, this blog is meant to document my own learning process and how I apply these concepts in real projects.
I hope it can also help others who are exploring similar paths.
